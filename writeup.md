## Key Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- **Login Page:**  
  Users must log in with a username and password to access the menu.  
  - **Hint:** The default credentials are shown on the login page (`admin` / `admin-password`).
- **Session Management:**  
  On successful login, the username is saved to `localStorage`.  
  If a user is not logged in, they are redirected to the login page when trying to access the menu.

### 2. **Menu Display**
- **Menu Page:**  
  After logging in, users are taken to the menu page, which displays a list of food items (e.g., burgers, fries, pizza).
- **AJAX Loading:**  
  Menu items are loaded dynamically from a menu-items.json file using AJAX.
- **Menu Cards:**  
  Each menu item is shown as a card with an image, name, description, price, and rating.

### 3. **Cart Functionality**
- **Add to Cart:**  
  Each menu card has an "Add to Cart" button. Clicking it adds the item to the cart. If the item already exists in the cart, its quantity increases.
- **Cart Badge:**  
  The cart button in the header displays a badge showing the total number of items in the cart and the total price.
- **Cart Sidebar:**  
  Clicking the cart button toggles a sidebar on the right, showing all cart items.
  - **Quantity Controls:** Users can increase, decrease, or directly edit the quantity of each item.
  - **Remove Items:** Users can remove items from the cart.
  - **Cart Total:** The total price of all items is displayed at the bottom of the sidebar.
- **Persistence:**  
  The cart is saved in `localStorage`, so it persists across page reloads.

### 4. **User Session and Logout**
- **Username Display:**  
  The logged-in username is shown in the header.
- **Logout:**  
  A logout button allows users to end their session, which removes the username from `localStorage` and redirects to the login page.

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- The app uses TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. **Login:**  
   The user logs in with the provided credentials. On success, they are redirected to the menu page.

2. **Browse Menu:**  
   The menu is loaded via AJAX and displayed as a grid of cards.

3. **Manage Cart:**  
   Users can add items to the cart, adjust quantities, or remove items. The cart sidebar can be toggled from the header.

4. **Session Management:**  
   The app checks for a logged-in user on every page load. If not found, it redirects to the login page.

5. **Logout:**  
   The user can log out at any time, which clears their session and returns them to the login screen.
